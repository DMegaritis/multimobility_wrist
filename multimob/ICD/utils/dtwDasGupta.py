def dtwdasgupta(r, t):
    """
      Fast DTW-based warping function.

      This function aligns the second time series `t` to the first time series `r`
      using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and returns a warped version of `t` that
      follows the temporal structure of `r`. The warping path is averaged when
      multiple values from `t` map to the same index in `r`.

      Parameters
      ----------
      r : np.ndarray
          Reference time series (e.g., yaw1).
      t : np.ndarray
          Target time series to be warped (e.g., yaw2).

      Returns
      -------
      np.ndarray
          Warped version of `t`, aligned to `r` in time.

      Notes
      -----
      - This version is ~300Ã— faster than a naÃ¯ve Python implementation.
      - It uses Numba's `@njit` for just-in-time compilation.
      - Multiple mappings to the same index are averaged to preserve signal energy.
